# 🌱 Pestora – Pest Monitoring System

An AI-based crop-specific pest monitoring system designed for Indian agriculture.  
Pestora analyzes leaf images to detect pest damage, provides confidence-aware predictions, and recommends organic-first treatment solutions.

## 📌 Project Overview

Pest infestation is one of the major causes of crop loss in vegetables, rice, and maize.

Traditional pest detection methods often result in:
- Late identification of pest attacks
- Excessive pesticide usage
- Soil and environmental damage
- Increased farming costs

Pestora provides an intelligent, affordable, and farmer-friendly AI solution.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads a leaf image.
2. User selects the crop type.
3. The system analyzes the image using a trained ML model.
4. A prediction is generated with a confidence score.
5. Organic solutions are suggested first.
6. Chemical pesticides are recommended only if necessary.
