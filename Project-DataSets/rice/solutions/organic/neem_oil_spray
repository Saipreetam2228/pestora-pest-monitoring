Neem Oil Spray – Organic Pest Control Solution
==============================================

Crop Applicability:
Rice, Maize, Tomato, and other vegetable crops

Category:
Organic / Eco-Friendly Pest Management

Purpose:
Neem oil spray is used to control common crop pests such as aphids, leaf miners, armyworms, whiteflies, and early-stage fungal infections. It works as a natural insect repellent, growth regulator, and feeding deterrent.

Active Component:
Azadirachtin (naturally derived from neem seeds)

----------------------------------------------

How It Works:
Neem oil disrupts the life cycle of insects by:
- Preventing feeding
- Inhibiting egg laying
- Interfering with larval growth
- Reducing pest reproduction

It does not immediately kill pests but gradually reduces infestation levels.

----------------------------------------------

Preparation (Standard 0.5%–1% Solution):

For 1 Liter of Spray:
- 5–10 ml cold-pressed neem oil
- 1 liter water
- 2–3 drops mild liquid soap (as emulsifier)

Mix thoroughly before spraying.

----------------------------------------------

Application Guidelines:

- Spray during early morning or late evening.
- Apply evenly on both upper and lower leaf surfaces.
- Repeat every 7–10 days if infestation persists.
- Avoid spraying under direct sunlight to prevent leaf burn.

----------------------------------------------

Best Used For:

Rice:
- Early-stage leaf blast prevention
- Brown spot (initial infection)
- Minor pest infestation

Maize:
- Fall armyworm (early stage)
- Leaf-eating caterpillars

Tomato:
- Early blight (preventive)
- Aphids
- Whiteflies

----------------------------------------------

Advantages:

- Environmentally safe
- Non-toxic to beneficial insects (when used correctly)
- Safe for soil health
- Cost-effective
- Reduces dependency on chemical pesticides

----------------------------------------------

Precautions:

- Do not over-concentrate the solution.
- Perform a small patch test before full application.
- Avoid spraying during peak sunlight hours.
- Store neem oil in a cool, dark place.

----------------------------------------------

Severity Recommendation (Pestora Logic):

If confidence < 90%:
→ Recommend Neem Oil Spray (Organic First Approach)

If confidence ≥ 90% and infestation is severe:
→ Recommend consulting agricultural expert and consider government-approved chemical pesticide.

----------------------------------------------

Note:
Neem oil is most effective in early or moderate stages of pest infestation. It is not recommended as a standalone solution for severe crop damage.
